                    <p class="description">For our diploma thesis a friend and I developed a tool to find extrasolar planets. What turned out to
                        be our biggest project yet is able to find traces of planetary existence in the brightness of distant
                        stars. In theory, a stars brightness decreases if a large object, say a planet ten times the size
                        of earth, transits inbetween the observer and the star itself. This periodc dampening of brightness
                        can be detected by looking at light curves. The data for those light curves is provided by NASA and
                        is publicly available.

                        The tool utilizes a pattern recognition neural network, which is trained to find unusual behaviour in star luminosity. Once
                        the planets are determined, further parameters can be calculated. By looking at the interval of occurence,
                        strength of dimming, and duration of the transit, properties like radius, mass, distance to star,
                        etc. are easily determined. We can even tell if a planet is likely to be habitable or hostile towards
                        life. The idea is to use a peer network that shares computing power to process the enormous amounts
                        of data by NASA and find new planets everday. The main core is written in python using Tensorflow(C++)
                        and wrapped in an electron application which offers UI. Server side is written in Java using mysql.

                    <p class="description">The goal for this project was to automate the process of stacking photos of the night sky. As a result
                        of small camera error a single image can be too noisy. To reduce noise, multiple shots are taken
                        with a small delay (up to a few seconds) before they are stacked on top of each other. However, due
                        to earths rotation, the sky shifts a few degrees inbetween shots, which makes the task of stacking
                        photos difficult. Deep Sky Stacker finds the same stars in a set of images and uses them to align
                        the samples, so the median/mean values can be determined. The tool is written in C# and utilizes
                        multi-threading to cope with the high performance demand.</p>

                        projects are in correlation with procedural generation. I am obsessed with the idea to generate landscapes,
                        objects, trees, even entire planets by just using mathematics. I achieved this goal by using Unreal
                        Engine 4(C++) and mainly Unity(C#) as a 3D engine. I have studied ways to make procedural generation
                        as realistic looking as possible, while also maintaining performance using C++ dlls, multi-threading
                        and GPU utilization.</p>
